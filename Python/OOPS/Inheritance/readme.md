Itnheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. The class that 
derives properties is called the derived class or child class and the class from which the properties are being derived
is called the base class or parent class. The benefits of inheritance are:

* It represents real-world relationships well.
* It provides the reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to 
add more features to a class without modifying it.
* It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B 
would automatically inherit from class A.
